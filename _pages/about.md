I am a postdoctoral researcher and teacher working on numerical analysis and mathematical modeling of partial differential equations at the Technical University of Darmstadt. My work in applied mathematics has an interdisciplinary character at the interface with engineering and computer science, and aims to improve the quality of computer simulations of problems in mechanics with emphasis on fluid dynamics. In particular, I develop mathematical models and algorithms that use flexible discretization techniques such as finite element and isogeometric analysis methods. I teach several classes in numerical analysis that are closely linked to my field of research.
